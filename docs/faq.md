## Do I Need To Configure IANA IPs?

No, IANA IPs are optional!

IANA IPs are just useful so that other Mycoria routers can connect to your router via the Internet. This also enables other routers to automatically optimize the network by connecting directly to your router if there is a lot of demand.
