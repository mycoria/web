# About

## Name

Mycoria is derived from [Mycorrhiza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza), which describes the symbiotic association between a fungus and a plant.

In a similar way, Mycoria forms a symbiotic relationship with the current Internet and possibly other networks in the future. This integration maintains compatibility while simultaneously enhancing these networks through superior connectivity, heightened security, and enhanced privacy.

## Team

Daniel Hååvi designed Mycoria and laid the groundwork. He was inspired by the [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/) network as well as his previous work building the [Safing Privacy Network](https://github.com/safing/spn).

Johannes Schabauer is working on bringing Mycoria into the world of IoT and embedded devices. He has lots of experience building and running [highly critical embedded sensor networks](https://doctec.at/) used for environmental monitoring and worker safety.

We'd love to get more people on board! Ping Daniel at [@dhaavi@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@dhaavi).
