Mycoria was designed and built by Daniel Hovie - at least until now!  
I'd love to work on this together with other people.

The concepts behind Mycoria are inspired by previous work on the [Safing Privacy Network](https://github.com/safing/spn) as well as the [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/) network.
