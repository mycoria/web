# Configure

If you do not have a config file yet, get the default config, including an ID, with:

``` sh
mycoria config generate XX # Replace XX with your country code.
```

_Why does Mycoria need your country code? [It helps with routing scalability.](/concept/)_

Currently, there is just one simple yaml file that holds all configuration.  
Here is an example with explanations:

``` yaml
router:
  # Identity of the router.
  # Important: This contains the _private_ key of the router.
  # Keep secret. Do not share.
  # This is generated by "mycoria config generate XX" and must not be changed.
  address:
    ip: fd1f:2cf7:903:b50b:e4cb:5c4c:270e:360c
    hash: BLAKE3
    type: Ed25519
    public: 8919290ac6c7e815...
    private: 505f0dc9473cd22e...
  
  # Define the "universe" the router is in.
  # Routers can only connect to other routers within the same universe.
  # You can use this to easily create own siloed Mycoria network.
  universe: test

  # Set a secret that every router in your universe must know to connect.
  # In case you want to stay alone. (The universe itself is not a secret.)
  universeSecret: correct horse battery stable

  # By default, Mycoria allows local traffic to any IP.
  # If you distrust content hosted within Mycoria, you can enable isolation.
  # If isolated, the router will only allow local traffic that goes friends.
  # The router will still help others in the network to route their traffic.
  isolate: true

  # Advertise how this router is reachable through IANA assigned IPs and names.
  iana:
  - "0.1.2.3"
  - "4.5.6.7"
  - example.com

  # Define to which routers this router should
  # always try to hold a connection to.
  connect:
  - "8.9.10.11"
  - example.org

  # Define on which ports (and protocols) the router listens.
  # Currently on tcp is supported, more will come. (WIP)
  listen:
  - tcp:47369
  
  # Enable the router to choose automatically to which other
  # routers it connects. Routers will optimize their connections
  # based on measurements and estimated location.
  # Not yet implemented, but please enable already. (WIP)
  autoConnect: true
  
  # If no other routers with public IANA IPs are known,
  # connect to one of these to bootstrap.
  bootstrap:
  - tcp://bootstrap.mycoria.org:47369

system:
  # Define the name of the tun interface.
  tunName: Mycoria
 
  # Define where and how to store the router state.
  # Must end with one of:
  # .json
  # .sqlite - coming soon (WIP)
  statePath: /home/user/.mycoria/state.json

# By default, no incoming traffic from Mycoria
# to your device is allowed by the router.
# You will need to define the services you want to allow here.
services:

# This is a public service, any other Mycoria router can access it.
- name: ping
  url: 'icmp6:'
  public: true

# You can also announce services for simple service discovery. (WIP)
- name: Project Status
  description: Website that shows the status of my project.
  url: 'tcp:80'
  public: true
  advertise: true

# You can also allow services only for friends or a custom list of routers.
- name: Secret Portal
  url: 'tcp:81'
  # Allow all friends.
  friends: true
  # Allow a list of router IPs or friend names.
  for:
  - fd1f:2cf7:903:b50b:e4cb:5c4c:270e:360c
  - frank

# Choose your friends wisely.
# Friends are used for simplified access control.
# You can only allow connections to friends with "isolate=true"
# You can only allow connections from friends to a service with "friends=true"
# If you have setup your DNS for Mycoria, you can also resolve their names.
friends:
- name: frank # Resolves as frank.myco.
  ip: fd1f:2cf7:903:b50b:e4cb:5c4c:270e:360c

# You can also add any custom names for resolving.
# Be sure to point your DNS server at Mycoria for these records.
resolve:
  status.myco: fd00::b909
```
